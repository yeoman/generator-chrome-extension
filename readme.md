# Chrome Extension generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension)

Maintainer: [Jimmy Moon](https://github.com/ragingwind)

> Chrome Extension generator that creates everything you need to get started with extension development. You can choose Browser UI(Browser,Page Action, Omnibox) type and select into permissions what you need.

## Getting Started

- First make a new directory, and `cd` into it: mkdir my-new-chrome-extension && cd $_
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-chrome-extension`
- Run: `yo chrome-extension`, optionally passing an extension name: yo chrome-extension [extension-name]

## Generators

Available generators:

* [chrome-extension](#app) (aka [chrome-extension:app](#app))

### App

Sets up a new Chrome Extension, generating all the boilerplate you need to get started.

```bash
yo chrome-extension
```

## Test Chrome Extension

To test, go to: chrome://extensions, enable Developer mode and load app as an unpacked extension.

## ES2015

ES2015 is default option in this generator that means you can use es2015 now for developing the Chrome extensions. However, at the moment, you need to execute `babel` task of grunt to compile to test and run the extension on Chrome, because [ES2015 is not full functionality on Chrome as yet](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/). a source written by es2015 is located at `scripts.babel` and runnable sources are will be created at `script` after compiling by grunt

```bash
grunt babel
```

If you would like to have a continuous compile by babel you can use `watch` task

```bash
grunt watch
```

## Grunt tasks

### Debug

Debug task helps reduce your effors during development extensions. If the task detects your changes of source files, Livereload([chromereload.js](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension/blob/master/app/templates/scripts/chromereload.js)) reloads your extension. If you would like to know more about Livereload and preview of Yeoman? Please see [Getting started with Yeoman and generator-webapp](http://youtu.be/zBt2g9ekiug?t=3m51s) for your understanding.

```bash
grunt debug
```

### Build

By default, generators compress the file that was created by building a js/css/html/resource file. You can distribute the compressed file using the Chrome Developer Dashboard to publish to the Chrome Web Store.

Run this command to build your Chrome Extension project.

```bash
grunt build
```

## Options

* `--no-babel`

  If you wouldn't use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) ES2015 transpiler.

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after
  scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework=[framework]`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for
  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.

* `--compass`

  Add support for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

 > WARN, Compiled files that generated by compass will be remained if your Chrome App is running on Chrome App container (with `grunt debug`). You should remove or ignore that files if you don't want to commit to repo.

* `--all-permissions`

  All of permissions of chrome extension will be shown
